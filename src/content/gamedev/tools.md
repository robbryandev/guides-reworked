# Tools
---
Right now is the best time in history to make a game. Tools are easier to access and tons of cheap or free versions are available for any discipline. Social programs such as [Guilded](https://www.guilded.gg/piratesoftware) and [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/piratesoftware) allow people to work together collaboratively from anywhere. With storage solutions like Google Drive and Github we can share files and work without a huge amount of financial buy in.

## There is no best engine.
---

Choose an engine that supports your style of game and your financial situation. Don't choose an engine based on what people say is the 'best' engine. There is no 'best' engine. There are great engines for different kinds of games. Tools are not diminished in value based on their price or lack thereof. There are also hundreds of engines available out there. Go [explore](https://enginesdatabase.com/) your options!

[Doki Doki Literature Club](https://store.steampowered.com/app/698780/Doki_Doki_Literature_Club/) was made in a free to use python tool called [Ren'Py](https://www.renpy.org/) that is specifically designed to make visual novels. [Risk of Rain](https://store.steampowered.com/app/248820/Risk_of_Rain/) was made in [GameMaker](https://www.yoyogames.com/en/gamemaker) and [MS Paint](https://web.archive.org/web/20210920062120/https://riskofraingame.com/team/). Yes, you read that right... MS Paint. The cost of your tools does not define the value of what you make.

Understand that this isn't an exhausive list of engines. There are tons of engines out there that are good or great for a variety of game styles. Go out there, find stuff, build stuff, and don't be an elitist about tools.

![Godot](gamedev/godot_splash.png)

[Godot](https://godotengine.org/) is a beast. Completely built by its community, fully open source, and entirely free. It excels in 3d is great for 2d and is now being used by major studios. You literally can't get a better deal as a small studio than free. Actually free. Not free with royalties. Real free. Use Godot. Seriously. Godot was used to make [Dome Keeper](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1637320/Dome_Keeper/) and [Endoparasitic](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2124780/Endoparasitic/).

![GameMaker](gamedev/gamemaker_splash.png)

[GameMaker](https://www.yoyogames.com/en/gamemaker) is a great engine for making 2d games but not very strong with 3d. You can use the free trial indefinitely for non-commercial use and it allows exports to Desktop targets as well as Web and Mobile. The monetization model is very competitive at 100$ one time for a lifetime license. For Console it's 80$ per month or 800$ per year. All of these prices have regionalized pricing making it affordable pretty much anywhere. They don't take royalties which is pretty great if your game takes off as well. Game Maker Studio was used to make [Heartbound](https://store.steampowered.com/app/567380/Heartbound/), [Hyper Light Drifter](https://store.steampowered.com/app/257850/Hyper_Light_Drifter/), [Risk of Rain](https://store.steampowered.com/app/248820/Risk_of_Rain/), [Nuclear Throne](https://store.steampowered.com/app/242680/Nuclear_Throne/), [Pizza Tower](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2231450/Pizza_Tower/) and [Undertale](https://store.steampowered.com/app/391540/Undertale/).

![Unreal Engine](gamedev/unreal_splash.jpg)

[Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/download) is a powerhouse in the 3d arena that has a great monetization model. If your game makes under 1,000,000$ over its lifetime you pay them nothing. Anything beyond that has a 5% royalty tagged onto it. They are also entirely free to use for unmonetized projects. Definitely great for startups but it can have a steep learning curve. Unreal was used to make [Fortnite](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/home), [Conan Exiles](https://store.steampowered.com/app/440900/Conan_Exiles/), [Kingdom Hearts 3](https://www.kingdomhearts.com/3/us/home/), and [Octopath Traveler](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/octopath-traveler-switch/).

![Ren'Py](gamedev/renpy_splash.png)

[Ren'Py](https://www.renpy.org/) is a fantastic engine specifically made for Visual Novels. It's completely free, easy to use, and has a great community around it. Definitely able to make some powerful and interesting games. Ren'py was used to make [Doki Doki Literature Club](https://store.steampowered.com/app/698780/Doki_Doki_Literature_Club/).

<div id='art_programs'>

## There is no best art program.
---

Just like with an engine you should choose an art program that works best for you. Just because a program costs more or is more revered in certain circles doesn't mean it's better for you or your workflow. Everyone works differently and everyone feels more or less comfortable with different software and hardware. If you want to use MS Paint on a tablet it's fine. If you want to use Photoshop on a Cintiq that's also fine.

![Aseprite](gamedev/aseprite_splash.png)

[Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) is the actual god of pixel art tools. Running at a cheap 20$ this powerhouse is super affordable but also carries an extra bonus. You can get it for free. If you compile Aseprite from [their github](https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite) it's entirely free software. Get this, use this, make sick pixel art.

---
![Gimp](gamedev/gimp_splash.png)

[Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) is an incredibly fantastic image editing tool generally looked down on for being the ugly brother of photoshop. That being said it has a few super powers that photoshop doesn't have... it's not owned by Adobe and it's completely free. We've used gimp for tons of stuff over the years from promotional art, to touch ups on logos, or making in-game assets. Definitely give this a look if you haven't before.

![Blender](gamedev/blender_splash.png)

[Blender](https://www.blender.org/) is a really powerful and entirely free 3d modeling and animation tool. It can do some absolutely insane stuff and as it continues to evolve it has met or exceeded the power of the best 3d modeling tools out there. If you want to build awesome 3d stuff then this is your go to workhorse.

<div id='audio_programs'>

## There is no best audio program.
---

I spoke to our musician [Stijn van Wakeren](http://stijnvanwakeren.com/) for this information as it's not really my area of expertise. You should definitely hit them up if you have questions about these programs or want more insight into why they are so powerful. That being said, here are some rad programs you can use to make music or sound effects with relative ease.

---
![FamiStudio](gamedev/famistudio_splash.jpg)

[FamiStudio](https://famistudio.org/) is an awesome free tool for making NES style chiptunes and sound effects. There is a pretty massive fan community built around it and a ton of easy to follow [YouTube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyECgqFbZPQ) to get you started making stuff. I really love the sounds that come out of this thing and it really hits that nostalgia factor. You can even review the [source](https://github.com/BleuBleu/FamiStudio) or compile it yourself. Honestly awesome.

![Anvil Studio](gamedev/anvil_splash.png)

[Anvil Studio](https://www.anvilstudio.com/) is a completely free MIDI audio design platform. If you're just starting out or really want a nice oldschool feel to your audio I really recommend checking this out. You can even print sheet music from your creations with one of their addons.

---
![FL Studio](gamedev/flstudio_splash.png)

[FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com/fl-studio) is by far the gold standard for audio tools. All of our music and sound effects were made in it. It's incredibly easy to use, insanely versatile letting you make a wide range of awesome stuff, and it's pretty affordable with a 100$ price tag for lifetime updates. If you're serious about making audio magic and want something powerful and long lasting then FL Studio is the right choice.
